/*
* Loop is a way to repeat the same action a certain amount of times until a specific condition is true

* Conditional Statements: if statements run a block of code if the condition is true. See conditional tab for more. 

if (name === 'Gadget') {
  alert ('Go, go, gadget arms!');
}

inside the parenthesis is a condition. name === "Gadget" if this condition is true then an alert dialogue appears.

* Loops are very similar. the while loop for instance has some of the same features

while () {

}
